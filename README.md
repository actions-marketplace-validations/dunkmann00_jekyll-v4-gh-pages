# jekyll-v4-gh-pages
Build and deploy Jekyll v4 with GitHub Pages dependencies preinstalled.

# Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml) for optional input parameters.

See [workflow_template.yml](workflow_template.yml) for an example of how to use
this in a GitHub workflow.

## This is not an official GitHub action.

This action uses other actions and projects, some are by GitHub and some are
my forks of GitHub's projects. The forks update the pages environment and use
Jekyll v4. The plugins that are installed are also updated to the latest
compatible versions.
